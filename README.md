#  Task-management-language

This project is a **domain-specific language (DSL)** for task management and scheduling, developed using **Xtext**.  
It was implemented as part of the coursework for the *Model-Driven Engineering* module at **King's College London**,  
*MSc Advanced Software Engineering*, 2025.

The DSL allows users to define tasks with estimated time, priority, repetition count, people requirements, and dependencies.  
It also supports group references, status assignment, and system-level time/people calculations.
Hope you find it interesting!ðŸ˜Š

##  Features

- `group`: define groups with custom size
- `add task`: define tasks with:
  - **Name** (unique string)
  - **Requirement** (description)
  - **Time** (float)
  - **Priority** (positive integer)
  - **Repeat count** (positive integer)
  - **People** (can use expressions with `+`, `*`, group references)
  - **Dependencies** (optional)
- `status of`: assign task status (`waiting`, `in_progress`, `completed`)
- `calculate time for`, `calculate total time`, `calculate total people`

---

##  Validation Rules

Implemented using Xtextâ€™s `@Check` validator and tested using XPect:

- Task name must be **unique**
- Group name must be **unique**
- `Priority` and `Repeat` must be **positive integers**
- `Requirement` must **start with a capital letter**
- **Circular dependencies** are not allowed
- People required (if literal) must be **positive**
- Quickfix for **lowercase requirement descriptions**

---

##  XPect Test Coverage

Test cases using `.xt` files verify:

-  Valid programs generate correct output
-  Invalid input (e.g. zero priority, duplicate names, cyclic dependencies) raises proper errors or warnings
-  All validation rules are covered and tested

---

##  How to Run

###  Runtime Eclipse

1. Launch runtime Eclipse
2. Create a new file with `.turtles` extension
3. Write a DSL program and save the file
`

###  XPect Testing

1. Open `test1.turtle.xt` or `test2.turtle.xt`
2. Run as: `JUnit Test`
3. XPect will validate your DSL and trigger generator logic
4. Generator will automatically create `filename.txt

##  Sample DSL Input

```turtles
group TeamA size 3
group TeamB size 2

add task "T1" Requirement "Analysis"
time 2.5 priority 1 repeat 2 times people 3 + 1 * TeamA

add task "T2" Requirement "Design"
time 1.0 priority 2 repeat 1 times people 2 + TeamB depends on "T1"

add task "T3" Requirement "Testing"
time 5.0 priority 1 repeat 3 times people TeamB depends on "T1"

status of "T1" is completed
status of "T2" is in_progress
status of "T3" is waiting

calculate time for "T3"
calculate total time
calculate total people
